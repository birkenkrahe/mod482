* What're you going to learn?

  * What are models?
  * When should we model?
  * Why many models?
  * Exercises
  * What's next?

* Definition

  #+begin_quote
  "Models are formal structures represented in mathematics and diagrams
  that help us understand the world."
  #+end_quote

* Motivation
  
  #+begin_quote
  "Practice [modeling] and you will better understand complex
  phenomena."
  #+end_quote

  What are "complex phenomena?"

** Dörner's definition

   #+attr_html: :height 200px
   [[./img/dorner.jpeg]]

   1) Problem is polytelic
   2) Variables evolve dynamically
   3) Variables are interdependent and compounded
   4) There is no clear problem definition
   5) There is no single cause and effect

** Exercise 
  
   Test Dörner's list:

   * AI
   * Covid
   * Climate change
   * Capitalism
   * Communism
   * Electric cars
   * Zombies

* Types of models

  #+begin_quote
  * Simplifications of the world (=abstractions)
  * Mathematical analogies (=functions)
  * Exploratory artificial constructs (=simulations)
  #+end_quote

  Models must be "tractable" (apply logic). What about metaphors?

* Many-model thinking

  #+begin_quote
"We achieve wisdom through a multiplicity of lenses."
  #+end_quote

** Criteria for many-model thinking

   #+begin_quote
 "The success of many-model thinking depends on a degree of separability."
   #+end_quote

** Exercise: decision-making

   Analyse a recent decision you've made: 
   * Which model did you use, and why?
   * If you used only one model, why?

* What's next?
