# Definition

> "Models are formal structures represented in mathematics and diagrams
> that help us understand the world."


<a id="orgcf79188"></a>

# Motivation

> "Practice [modeling] and you will better understand complex
> phenomena."

What are "complex phenomena?"


<a id="orga48758c"></a>

## Dörner's definition

![img](./img/dorner.jpeg)

1.  Problem is polytelic
2.  Variables evolve dynamically
3.  Variables are interdependent and compounded
4.  There is no clear problem definition
5.  There is no single cause and effect


<a id="orgc643811"></a>

## Exercise

Test Dörner's list:

-   AI
-   Covid
-   Climate change
-   Capitalism
-   Communism
-   Electric cars
-   Zombies


<a id="org4343813"></a>

# Types of models

> -   Simplifications of the world (=abstractions)
> -   Mathematical analogies (=functions)
> -   Exploratory artificial constructs (=simulations)

Models must be "tractable" (apply logic). What about metaphors?


<a id="org42c31a6"></a>

# Many-model thinking

> "We achieve wisdom through a multiplicity of lenses."


<a id="orge07d5cd"></a>

## Criteria for many-model thinking

> "The success of many-model thinking depends on a degree of separability."


<a id="orgeaaadbb"></a>

## Exercise: decision-making

Analyse a recent decision you've made: 

-   Which model did you use, and why?
-   If you used only one model, why?
