# Followup 1st Sprint Review Sept 9

## Presentations in general

It was a good start for this round of sprint reviews. This was
quite difficult given that you know little about modeling as of
yet. Also, you're going to learn quite different tools - tools
that you will not necessarily be able to use for your essays.

At this point, the topics of your essays are not written in stone:
if research proves too difficult, you may want to pick a simpler
or a different topic.

A few of you did not participate in the sprint reviews: please
post your reviews in the discussion forum so that I can comment
and/or talk to me. Do not drop the next deadline. You're up to
present next time!

Always pay extra attention to references and to proper citing. I
am a stickler for consistency and completeness of references. 

For the next sprint review on October 7, you need to create
slides according to the (minimal) sprint review rules.


## Sprint review presentations

Congratulations on the first round of presenters: all of these
were super interesting. The research questions throughout are
still too broad. Use literature or other sources to narrow them.

I will leave comments on individual projects in the discussion
forum, especially if I come across interesting sources. As a
participant, you can opt to unsubscribe from the forum at any
time, if you feel that you're getting too much email!
