* What's a process?

  [[./img/process.png]]

  * What are the elements of any process?
  * What's special (if anything) about "business processes"?
  * What's special (if anything) about "IT processes"?[fn:1]
  * Does data play any special role?

* Process modeling

  The three-fold purpose of process modeling:

  * Shared world view (key)
  * Process standardization (means)
  * Process optimization (end)

** Shared world view

    *Example: hiring process.*

    What does an IT person see and talk about?

    What does an HR person see and talk about?

**** IT view

*** Answer

    New problem: process model is not *standardized*.

** Process standardization

   ARIS = Meta model for process modeling ("model of models")

* EPCs
** What are "Event-driven Process Chains"?

   #+begin_quote
   The event-driven Process Chain (EPC) is a flow chart for business
   process modeling introduced by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August-Wilhelm_Scheer][August-Wilhelm Scheer]] in the early
   1990s. It illustrates the business process workflows. It uses
   graphical symbols to show the control-flow structure of a business
   process as a chain of events and functions. ([[vp][Visual Paradigm, 2021]])

** EPC elements

*** Events and functions

    | Function     | Activities carried out by a person |
    | Event        | Status triggered by a function     |
    | Control flow | Sequence of activities             |

    [[./img/event.png]]

**** Event and function rules

     * Every EPC starts and ends with an event
     * Events and functions alternate

*** Operators and tokens

    | Operator           | Meaning                                     |
    |--------------------+---------------------------------------------|
    | AND                | All following flows are executed            |
    | OR                 | One or several following flows are executed |
    | XOR (exclusive OR) | Only one of the following flows is executed |

    #+attr_html: :width 300px
    [[./img/operator.png]]

**** Operator rules

     * Must use operator (only) when flow splits or merges
     * Token rule: Splitting operator = joining operator
     * Only the AND operator can split the flow after an event

     #+attr_html: :width 400px
     [[./img/loops.png]]

*** Process interfaces

    * Process interfaces are used to link independent processes
    * Trigger following process or signal preceding process
    * Can only be at the start or at the end of a process diagram

      #+attr_html: :width 300px
    [[./img/interface.png]]

*** Organizational units

    * Organizational units are only connected to functions
    * They are RACI - responsible, accountable, consulted and informed

      [[./img/raci.png]]

** Extended Event-driven Process Chain (eEPC)

   eEPCs integrate the other views of the ARIS house:
   * Roles/organization
   * Products/services
   * Data input/output

     [[./img/eepc.png]]
    
** EPC rules summary

   
   
    | 1 | Every EPC starts and ends with an event                 |
    | 2 | Events and functions alternate                          |
    | 3 | Must use operator (only) when flow splits or merges     |
    | 4 | Splitting operator = joining operator                   |
    | 5 | Only the AND operator can split the flow after an event |
    | 6 | Interfaces only before or after a process               |
    | 7 | Organizational units are only connected to functions    |
