* What will you learn?

  * What are the elements of any process?
  * What's special (if anything) about "business processes"?

** What are "Event-driven Process Chains"?

   #+begin_quote
   The event-driven Process Chain (EPC) is a flow chart for business
   process modeling introduced by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August-Wilhelm_Scheer][August-Wilhelm Scheer]] in the early
   1990s. It illustrates the business process workflows. It uses
   graphical symbols to show the control-flow structure of a business
   process as a chain of events and functions. ([[vp][Visual Paradigm, 2021]])
