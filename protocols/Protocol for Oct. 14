A. Dr. Marcus Birkenkrahe (MB) introduced the idea of the Minto Pyramid principle with a video
  1. The one big key message (top of the pyramid) needs multiple supporting arguments, which all need their own credible supporting data.
  2. Only then can a conclusion be made valid and convincing.
  3. Only items of the same kind are grouped horizontally.
  4. Applications of the Minto Pyramid principle were discussed both in the video and about MB's past presentations
  
B. MB introduced SCQA (defined below) and how it relates to the pyramid and our final paper projects
  1. Most important part of the pyramid is the introduction at the top, which is SCQ
  2. S = Situation
    i. Context on current situation
    ii. Audience should be nodding and agreeing because it is not new information and they understnad
  3. C = Complication
    i. Should have some raised eyebrows from the audience
  4. Q = Question
    i. Audience should be getting antsy - excited/concerned for the speaker, eager to hear the answer
  5. A = Answer, which stems from the entire body of the pyramid
  
C. MB gave examples of SCQA being applied with each step being filled in
 
D. Practice 1 - MB asked the class to now fill in missing spots in SCQA applications
  1. Given S and C, what are Q and A?
  2. Given S, Q, and A, what is C?
  3. Given C, Q, and A, what is S?
  4. As these were answered, the class offered various possibilities for each.
    i. MB addressed each answer and why it would/would not work for that spot
      a. Situation should not contain information that would not classify as "background information"
      b. Complication should contain new information that the audience can agree on as problematic
      c. Question should connect with audience and be the only thing on their minds; they are ready for an answer
      d. Answer should satisfy S, C, and Q with supporting data according to the Minto Pyramid princple discussed earlier
      
E. Practice 2 - MB had the class apply SCQA method to our final paper topics
  1. Class was to apply SCQA, specifically SCQ, to form an outline for the introduction to the class' final papers
  2. Class applied SCQ and posted it to a discussion forum
  3. After 15 minutes, MB opened the discussion forum page on the board and presented each case
    i. Constructive criticism was offered by MB and the class on each member's SCQ
    ii. Similarly to Practice 1, whenever parts of the class' SCQ case did not match the purpose of S, C, and/or Q, MB guided the student(s) on why they broke the purpose and how it can be made better
