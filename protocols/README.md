# Session Protocols

Post your protocol here (PDF or markdown) no later than one week
after the seminar. Take a look at [my example protocol](https://github.com/birkenkrahe/mod482/blob/main/protocols/08_23_birkenkrahe.md) (from the AI
course).

The protocol has no upper or lower word limit, and the format is
open. I am looking for a reflection of your participation in class,
of content that you found interesting etc.

If you make claims or reference other people's work, don't forget to
cite them.

You'll get (private) feedback from me (via email).

If you miss your slot (see [schedule](https://github.com/birkenkrahe/mod482/blob/main/schedule.md)), the next person in line will
automatically swap with you.
