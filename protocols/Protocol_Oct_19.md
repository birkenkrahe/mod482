 ## Test
 At the beggining of the class there was a short test on schoology. The test covered  The Minto Pyramid Principle and SCQA.
 After everone had taken the test we reviewed the answers as a class.
 ## Lecture
 ### processes
The lecture covered processes and EPC's. A process is defined by websters dictionary as a 
"a series of actions that produce something or that lead to a particular result"<sup>[1](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/process)</sup>
While this was not the exact defenition discussed during the class it is still very relavent to the processes that were discussed later in the lecture.
After discussing the defenition of a process the lecture began to focus more on the elements that make up a process. The terminology varies by field and 
language but all of them shared a similar event to action structure. Following that Dr.B lectured on the purpose of making process models.He explained 
the three purposes of creating these models: sharing world view, Standarization, and iptimization.
### Event-Driven Process Chains
The event-driven Process chain was large part of the lecture.EPC's are a type of business model which utilizes graphics to visually represent a process.
A good explanation of what EPC's are is given in the lecture linked above.EPCs consist of a few different elements.The first element of any EPC is an Event.
Events are steps in processes that are the result of or the cause for the next element fo EPC's Functions. The Function is just as essential as events are to an EPC.
A function is an action that occurs within a proccess. The example that was used in class to visualize these elements HUNGRY --> Eat-->Full.
In this example Hungry would be the event that causes the function Eat to occur which then causes the event full. Just like in this example every EPC must start and end with an 
event.The next element of EPCs is operators. Operators are like gates for the flow of the function. Operators can either divide or bring together parts of an EPC. The three
operators that were covered were : AND,OR,and XOR. Orginisational Units are another element of EPCs. Orginizational Units acompany functions and show who or what should carry out
the function. All of the Elements of EPC's must follow certian rules:
   -	Every EPC starts and ends with an event
   -  Events and functions alternate
   -	Must use operator (only) when flow splits or merges
   - 	Splitting operator = joining operator
   -	Only the AND operator can split the flow after an event
   - 	Interfaces only before or after a process
   -	Organizational units are only connected to functions
   -	All process elements must be connected by flow
   - 	Loops are allowed as long as they're finite
   -	Trivial events can be omitted
### Signavio Demo
In preparation for the demo next class a breif demonstration of signavio was given. It did not cover how to create EPCs but only
how to make and save a file in Signavio.
