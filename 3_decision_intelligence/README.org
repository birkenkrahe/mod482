* Decision intelligence

I don't really like the term but it has stuck as an umbrella term for
important data science applications. I could also have called it
"performance management" (since performance measurement and
optimization is the purpose of most business related decisions), or
"data science tools", since data science covers data and process
related disciplines.

In any case, the breakdown delivers a framework of modeling languages,
applications and platforms that are currently relevant for industrial
data science, and that can also (via the languages) be used to
structure the material of this course (which otherwise may look like a
bit of a potpourri).
