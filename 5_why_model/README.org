* Why model? 

The purpose of this section is to introduce you to some model criteria
and uses. The uses vary (across problems), but the general benefits of
models can still be named (REDCAPE is Page's attempt at doing that).

It is also useful to classify models - we classify by structural and
functional dimensions. Then there are many-to-one uses of models (many
models to crack complex problems), and also one-to-many uses. I
present "system constellations" as an example for a model of the
simulation-analogy type.

Analogies are tricky. I've summarized some issues with analogies in
the lecture, and given a few simple and a few complicated
examples. Basically, you need to be thinking through the model
limitations more carefully when the model is based on an analogy, like
"crime is a disease", or "organizations are like families".
