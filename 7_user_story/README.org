* What is a user story?

  #+begin_quote
  User stories are short, simple descriptions of a *feature* told from
  the perspective of the *person* who desires the new capability,
  usually a user or customer of the *system*. ([[cohn][Cohn, 2021]])
  #+end_quote

** Simple example

   User stories are short and can be thought of as fitting on an index
   card.

   [[./img/helpdesk.png]]

   * Who is the *person*?
   * What is the *feature*?
   * Why does the person *want* it?
   * Which *system* is this?

** Epic, story and task

   [[./img/userstory.png]]

   User stories are embedded in a larger story, also called an
   "epic". The key reason to create a story is to derive tasks from
   it. To do this, the story must be small and specific.

* INVEST criteria

  To be useful in a software engineering project, user stories need
  to fulfil certain criteria. A user story needs to be:

  | 1) | Independent | To derive unique tasks from it              |
  | 2) | Negotiable  | To be able to talk to the customer about it |
  | 3) | Valuable    | To generate a real value to the customer    |
  | 4) | Estimable   | To be measurable (e.g. for burndown chart)  |
  | 5) | Small       | To derive doable tasks from it              |
  | 6) | Testable    | To be checked for completion                |

* More Examples

** Vehicle app

   This is a common place application for many modern cars:

   [[./img/vehicle.png]]

   What could be on the back of this card?[fn:1]

** Airline app

   Here is another one, which is common place in airline travel.

   [[./img/airline1.png]]

   The back of the card shows individual desirable features. The front
   of the card is more of an epic - it leads to half a dozen more
   specific user stories.

   [[./img/airline2.png]]

** Trello example 

   This example comes from a student project: the students worked with
   a large retailer who wanted to create a virtual show room. There
   are four epics with several user stories each. 

   [[./img/trello.png]]

** Jira example

   Software companies that specialize in productivity tools like
   Atlassian offer complete User Story and Scrum tool boxes. The image
   shows a Scrum backlog (task list) that contains user stories, and
   matching features in the popular tool Jira [[jira
][(Rehkopf, 2021)]].

* Practice!

  This short [[samsung][Samsung commercial (2017)]] contains several user
  stories. Find them! Can you suggest tasks following from the
  stories?[fn:2]

  [[./img/iphone.png]]

* Sprint review challenge

  Include at least one user story and the task(s) derived from it.

  #+begin_quote
  Example: "As a comp sci student, I want to know what technical
  jargon in my research topic X may come up in a job interview"
  #+end_quote

  Task selection:
  * Look at recent job applications for X
  * Check recent research papers on X
  * Check recent conference talks on X
  * Make a master list of 10 jargon terms
  * Define each term in your own words
  * Use one term per week in conversations

* Footnotes

[fn:2]The user stories come out of several instances of inconvenience
that the user experiences: [0:02] User does not want to queue for his
new phone. [0:10] User needs storage to make more high-res
photos. [0:18] User wants to write notes by hand. [0:23] User wants to
dry his new phone after it got wet. [0:40] User wants to charge his
phone wirelessly.

[fn:1]As [[decapua][DeCapua (2016)]] points out:
#+begin_quote
this user-story description captures several very subjective
ideas. What does “by the time I get to it” mean? Does it mean “user
should walk two to three minutes more slowly than usual” to ensure
that the vehicle is on when he arrives? Or does it mean “user should
press auto-start 15 minutes prior to arrival” to ensure that the
vehicle is actually “warmed up” upon user arrival? Of course not. Most
users would expect a car to start within five seconds so that it would
be warming for at least five or ten minutes before they’re ready to
drive.
