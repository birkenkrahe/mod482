* What will you learn?

  * Business Process Model and Notation
  * Object-oriented process modeling
  * Practice in the Signavio Process Editor

* BPMN object summary

  Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0 has four main groups
  of shapes or objects. Source: [[lucidchart][Lucidchart, 2020]].

** Flow objects (Action/Decision)

   * Annotation
   * Message (data)

   For Signavio Process Manager, open the "Getting started" sidebar
   inside the Process Manager explorer window under "Help".

   [[https://documentation.signavio.com/suite/en-us/Content/process-manager/userguide/bpmn/modeling.htm][This Signavio document]] gives a complete, structured account of all
   the most relevant aspects of BPMN with many examples (SAP Signavio,
   2021).

   [[https://camunda.com/bpmn/reference/][This guide from Camunda]] (with link to a free BPMN online editor),
   is also very good and complete.

* BPMN case

  Creating and explaining this model takes about as much time as
  eating a big icecream (7 min) - [[https://youtu.be/BwkNceoybvA?t=346][Link]].

** BPMN rules

   [[./img/summary.gif]]

   | NO. | BPMN MODELING RULE                                          |
   |-----+-------------------------------------------------------------|
   |   1 | Every participant gets a pool or a lane inside a pool       |
   |   2 | Every pool contains exactly one process                     |
   |   3 | A process has at least one start and one end event          |
   |   4 | Sequence flow (Action) flows only within pools              |
   |   5 | Message flow (Communication) flows only between pools       |
   |   6 | All process elements must be named                          |
   |   7 | Decision points (exclusive gateways) have questions         |
   |   8 | Actors with little to do can become additional participants |
   |   9 | Split or joined sequence flows need gateways                |
   |  10 | Opened gateways must be closed                              |

   BPMN has slightly different rules than EPC. In addition, because
   it is primarily (though not only - see process mining and BPEL)
   for human consumption, the style of a diagram carries extra weight:

   | BPMN diagrams should be readable                   |
   | BPMN diagrams can be infinite in size              |
   | BPMN diagrams run from the left to the right       |
   | BPMN diagrams avoid loops (instead: attributes)    |
   | BPMN diagrams distinguish action and communication |

   Here is a complete EPC "cheat sheet" (Source: SAP Signavio)

* Footnotes

[fn:5]The idea for this problem came from a figure in a book I'm
reading, "Tiny C Projects" ([[gookin][Gookin, 2021]]):

[fn:4]Business processes generate added value.

[fn:3]Different languages use different terms:(1)
*Functions*/tasks/actions/activities; (2) *events*/status/trigger; (3)
*flow*/path/sequence/connectors; (4) *operators*/gateways/decisions.

[fn:2]Any productive ERP system contains many more transactions than
that. In practice, these are often modeled as BPMN diagrams, or as ER
Diagrams, if customer-facing or database operations are being
modeled. For more about ERP systems, see this tutorial ([[sap][SAP]]).

to IT services. More: [[wiki][Wikipedia]] (2021).
