[fn:5]The idea for this problem came from a figure in a book I'm
reading, "Tiny C Projects" ([[gookin][Gookin, 2021]]):

[fn:4]Business processes generate added value.

[fn:3]Different languages use different terms:(1)
*Functions*/tasks/actions/activities; (2) *events*/status/trigger; (3)
*flow*/path/sequence/connectors; (4) *operators*/gateways/decisions.

[fn:2]Any productive ERP system contains many more transactions than
that. In practice, these are often modeled as BPMN diagrams, or as ER
Diagrams, if customer-facing or database operations are being
modeled. For more about ERP systems, see this tutorial ([[sap][SAP]]).

to IT services. More: [[wiki][Wikipedia]] (2021).
