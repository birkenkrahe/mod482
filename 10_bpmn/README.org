* What will you learn?

  * Business Process Model and Notation
  * Object-oriented process modeling
  * Practice in the Signavio Process Editor

* BPMN object summary

  Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0 has four main groups
  of shapes or objects. Source: [[lucidchart][Lucidchart, 2020]].

** Flow objects (Action/Decision)

   [[https://documentation.signavio.com/suite/en-us/Content/process-manager/userguide/bpmn/modeling.htm][This Signavio document]] gives a complete, structured account of all
   the most relevant aspects of BPMN with many examples (SAP Signavio,
   2021).

   [[https://camunda.com/bpmn/reference/][This guide from Camunda]] (with link to a free BPMN online editor),
   is also very good and complete.

* BPMN case studies
** Eating icecream

   Creating and explaining this model takes about as much time as
   eating a big icecream (7 min) - [[https://youtu.be/BwkNceoybvA?t=346][Link]].

** Job application process

   Part 1: demonstration of creating a simple BPMN workflow for an
   application process. The software used here is irrelevant - you're
   still using the BPMN standard and you can recreate these models in
   a process modeling editor of your choice - bpmn.io, signavio, ARIS
   or even MS Visio will do. Source: Aptero Solutions, 2011.

   Part 2: in this demonstration, which follows on part 1, you see how
   to implement the concept of multiple pools and message flow across
   pools using the same example as before, an application process. The
   process participants involved are: the applicant and the HR
   department of a company. Source: Aptero Solutions, 2011.

** IT service

   This example is (for now) only available in German.

** BPMN rules

   [[./img/summary.gif]]

   | NO. | BPMN MODELING RULE                                          |
   |-----+-------------------------------------------------------------|
   |   1 | Every participant gets a pool or a lane inside a pool       |
   |   2 | Every pool contains exactly one process                     |
   |   3 | A process has at least one start and one end event          |
   |   4 | Sequence flow (Action) flows only within pools              |
   |   5 | Message flow (Communication) flows only between pools       |
   |   6 | All process elements must be named                          |
   |   7 | Decision points (exclusive gateways) have questions         |
   |   8 | Actors with little to do can become additional participants |
   |   9 | Split or joined sequence flows need gateways                |
   |  10 | Opened gateways must be closed                              |

   BPMN has slightly different rules than EPC. In addition, because
   it is primarily (though not only - see process mining and BPEL)
   for human consumption, the style of a diagram carries extra weight:

   | BPMN diagrams should be readable                   |
   | BPMN diagrams can be infinite in size              |
   | BPMN diagrams run from the left to the right       |
   | BPMN diagrams avoid loops (instead: attributes)    |
   | BPMN diagrams distinguish action and communication |

   Here is a complete EPC "cheat sheet" (Source: SAP Signavio)

** BPMN diagram with mistakes

   Which rule violations can you see in the following diagram
   (GitHub)? The total number is[fn:6] = 8 errors - I count a total of
   11 additional rule violations. So the total is closer to 20.

** Build your first own BPMN diagram

   Here is my (recommended) BPMN modeling workflow.

   | NO. | STEP                                       | ACTION           |
   |-----+--------------------------------------------+------------------|
   |   1 | Who are the actors (organizational units)? | Pools and lanes  |
   |   2 | What are the start and end events?         | Gather them      |
   |   3 | Which other events or functions are there? | Gather them      |
   |   4 | Is there any communication?                | Add message flow |
   |   5 | What is the happy path?                    | Model it         |
   |   6 | Can any events or tasks be parallelized?   | Add gateways     |
   |   7 | Which decisions or changes are involved?   | Add gateways     |
   |   8 | Anything else?                             | Add it           |
   |   9 | Check diagram                              | Spell checker    |
   |  10 | Save and share diagram                     | Save and share   |

* Footnotes

[fn:6]According to the Signavio "spell checker" for BPMN 2.0 diagrams.

[fn:5]The idea for this problem came from a figure in a book I'm
reading, "Tiny C Projects" ([[gookin][Gookin, 2021]]):
#+attr_html: :width 500px
[[./img/cycle.png]]

[fn:4]Business processes generate added value.

[fn:3]Different languages use different terms:(1)
*Functions*/tasks/actions/activities; (2) *events*/status/trigger; (3)
*flow*/path/sequence/connectors; (4) *operators*/gateways/decisions.

[fn:2]Any productive ERP system contains many more transactions than
that. In practice, these are often modeled as BPMN diagrams, or as ER
Diagrams, if customer-facing or database operations are being
modeled. For more about ERP systems, see this tutorial ([[sap][SAP]]).

[fn:1]Cp. ITIL library of IT processes, especially with regards
to IT services. More: [[wiki][Wikipedia]] (2021).
