** Data science guest speaker, November 18, 11:45 Maxwell Room

   From Dr. Wesley Beal (Lyon/English):

   #+begin_quote
   I'm hosting a speaker for the HFP on Thursday, and if you or any of
   your students would be interested in his talk you're more than
   welcome to attend. Please consider spreading the word.

   * Michael Simeone, director of Data Science and Analytics at
     Arizona State University, will deliver a talk entitled “Beyond
     ‘Fake News’: A Study in How to Study Misinformation" on Thursday,
     Nov 18 from 11:45-12:50. We will meet in the Maxfield Room, and
     he will join us remotely; we're allowed to bring lunches
     downstairs from the cafeteria. Dr. Simeone will discuss current,
     data-driven research on misinformation. Dr. Simeone also co-hosts
     a podcast, Misinfo Weekly. I asked him which episodes he would
     recommend for students interested in getting a head start on his
     talk, and here's what he suggested:
   * S1E1 on Information literacy:  https://play.acast.com/s/misinfo-weekly/episode-1
   * S1E8 on Instagram and "COVID parties": https://play.acast.com/s/misinfo-weekly/covid-parties
   * S1E7 on the Wayfair furniture conspiracy: https://play.acast.com/s/misinfo-weekly/the-wayfair-conspiracy-expensive-furniture-or-a-front-for-ch

   May or may not be the kind of content you're interested in, but I
   thought I'd at least offer!
