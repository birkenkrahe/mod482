* What is this?

  A place for irregular articles of possible interest to students of
  the DSC 482.02 "Data modeling" course, mostly to avoid lengthy
  emails and to park content that I may want to develop later on time
  permitting.

* Getting started (for real) - September 7, 2021

  This is my first diary entry for the data modeling seminar
  only. We're starting with week 4 of the course, and I feel refreshed
  after Labor Day, which I used to not work at all[fn:1].

  Frankly, this course has suffered from the fact that it feels
  "sandwiched" between two other courses that commanded more of my
  attention so far: the introductory data science course (DSC 101) is
  kind of my flagship course - the first "proper" data science course
  I ever developed and taught successfully at graduate level. The AI
  seminar (482.01) was tricky, because I didn't know if I could do it
  before I did it! This seminar, however, is packed with methods and
  tools that I know like the back of my hand.

  Knowing something as well as I know modeling meant that I had
  difficulty meeting you, the students, at your level of understanding
  and interest. I'm only slowly finding my groove here, and I'm sure
  it's the same for you.

  Also, the emphasis on academic writing (a final essay is one of the
  main deliverables) means that the students have to be able to
  express themselves. My feeling is that this is difficult and unusual
  for them - even though they must've had some liberal arts classes -
  I thought that these would be mostly about writing and arguing.

  And then there's the need to grade and evaluate achievements. The
  grading scheme for any of these courses is fragmented. For the
  seminars, participation is graded (15%). So this week, I'm going to
  challenge the students more on this front: we'll begin each class
  with a 5 minute pair practice designed to foster (a) peer
  discussion, (b) accurate expression, and (c) pithy presentations.

  I'll get this started by bringing a question to class, but
  ultimately I hope that the students will bring questions for
  discussion. We'll see how it goes - fall is upon us, and life is
  good!

* When learning data science, trust your intuition - November 10, 2021

  #+begin_quote
  "If we want to solve a problem that we have never solved before, we
  must leave the door to the unknown afar." -Richard Feynman
  #+end_quote

  Feynman's remark is relevant because learning a lot of new things is
  a problem you may have never solved before. My advice mirrors
  Feynman's: follow your instincts rather than clamp down on them and
  follow a structure that someone else may have recommended because it
  suits him or her. In new fields like data science, a particular
  type of blog post is very popular: "10 ways to get started with data
  science", or "The only way to become a good data scientist FAST", or
  "5 books that any data scientist must have read", etc. Most of these
  articles are worthless, but the meta message for you is: find your
  own way through the maze, and rely on what you already
  know. Otherwise you'll have very little chance to learn, retain and
  use what you read, study and see. The deeper reason is that data
  science, including modeling and everything we do, is quite
  fragmented and still in flux - unlike e.g. mathematics, which is a
  solid building. If you want to learn maths, the floor plan is well
  known and well laid out. Not so in data science.

* Footnotes

[fn:1]Instead, I spent time outside (loving Batesville more and more -
why would anyone ever want to live elsewhere?), talked to a lot of
people, and christened my brand new PS5 video gaming console by
continuing Eivor's quest in "Valhalla", an Assassin's Creed
game. Crossed the 150 hour boundary on Sunday, assassinating my way
through 8th century England. The PS5 is a gamer's dream come
true. Details (except the price, ummmh) upon request in class!
