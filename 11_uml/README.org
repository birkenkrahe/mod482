* What is UML?

** UML vs. Flowcharts vs. EPC vs. BPMN

   | Diagram    | Purpose                          | Example                     | Where       |
   |------------+----------------------------------+-----------------------------+-------------|
   | Flowcharts | Model flow                       | Programming loop            | Programming |
   | EPC        | Model transactions               | Credit card check           | Bank        |
   | BPMN       | Model process with communication | IT support communication    | IT Service  |
   | UML        | Model systems and processes      | Infrastructure and services | Airport     |

   In UML, one can also model static systems (without flow).

** How UML came about

   | Time frame  | Paradigm                    | Problem           | Solution         |
   |-------------+-----------------------------+-------------------+------------------|
   | Until 1970s | Software creation is an art | Complexity crisis | Engineering      |
   | Until 1980s | Split data and procedures   | Fragmentation     | ERD / Petri Nets |
   | Until 1990s | Object orientation          | Reusability       | UML 0.9[fn:1]    |
   | Since 2005  | Integrated modeling         | Standardisation   | UML 2.0 (OMG)[fn:2]    |

** How do you use UML?

   #+attr_html: :width 400px
   [[./img/use.gif]]

   | UML as a sketch               | Convey key points, then throw away                                                                                                                |
   | UML as a blueprint            | Detailed system specification. Use UML tool. Reverse and forward engineering to keep model in line with system. Turn portions of model into code. |
   | UML as a programming language | Go from UML model to executable code: every aspect of the system is modeled. Model enables deployment to different environments.                  |

*** Software engineering views

** Case study: airport

   Airports are complicated ([[https://youtu.be/gWYTnc7m9mE][video]], [[dw][DW 2020]])

   Some services in an airport:

   #+attr_html: :width 400px
   [[./img/airport.png]]

   Three relevant models:
   1) Business system model (passenger services)
   2) IT systems model (enabling passenger services)
   3) System integration model (interacting IT systems)

   #+attr_html: :width 400px
   [[./img/airport1.png]]

   8 diagram types used to model the whole airport ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/mod482/blob/main/11_uml/img/airport.pdf][PDF]]):

*** Use case diagrams: issuing a boarding pass

    First draft of the use case:

    [[./img/airport_usecase1.png]]

    Extended use case diagram:

    #+attr_html: :width 400px

*** Activity diagrams: checking in

    ~Passenger services~ overview (low level of detail):

    More detail: ~Passenter checks in~:

    The same diagram but without explanations:

    [[./img/airport_activity3.png]]

*** Sequence diagrams: check in and boarding

    Constructing sequence of actions:

    #+attr_html: :width 400px
    [[./img/airport_sequence1.png]]

    The entire sequence spans the business use cases ~check-in~ and
    ~boarding~:

    #+attr_html: :width 400px
    [[./img/airport_sequence2.png]]

*** Package diagram: organisational units

    Constructing a package diagram by collecting organizational
    units/roles:

    #+attr_html: :width 400px
    [[./img/airport_package1.png]]

    Package diagram for the organization unit ~Passenger service~:

    #+attr_html: :width 400px
    [[./img/airport_package1.png]]

*** Class diagram: Passenger services

    Illustration of class "generalization". In OOP terms, ~List of
    checked in passengers~ and ~List of passengers not yet on board~
    inherits attributes and methods from ~Passenger List~.

    #+attr_html: :width 400px
    [[./img/airport_class1.png]]

    Classes of the internal view of the business system:

    #+attr_html: :width 400px
    [[./img/airport_class3.png]]

    Class diagram of ~Passenger services~ including associations
    between them. This way of drawing class diagrams focuses on the
    relationships, not on the methods/functions or abilities of the
    classes.
