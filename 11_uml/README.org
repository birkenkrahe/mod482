* What is UML?

** UML vs. Flowcharts vs. EPC vs. BPMN

   | Diagram    | Purpose                          | Example                     | Where       |
   |------------+----------------------------------+-----------------------------+-------------|
   | Flowcharts | Model flow                       | Programming loop            | Programming |
   | EPC        | Model transactions               | Credit card check           | Bank        |
   | BPMN       | Model process with communication | IT support communication    | IT Service  |
   | UML        | Model systems and processes      | Infrastructure and services | Airport     |

   In UML, one can also model static systems (without flow).

** How UML came about

   | Time frame  | Paradigm                    | Problem           | Solution         |
   |-------------+-----------------------------+-------------------+------------------|
   | Until 1970s | Software creation is an art | Complexity crisis | Engineering      |
   | Until 1980s | Split data and procedures   | Fragmentation     | ERD / Petri Nets |
   | Until 1990s | Object orientation          | Reusability       | UML 0.9[fn:1]    |
   | Since 2005  | Integrated modeling         | Standardisation   | UML 2.0 (OMG)[fn:2]    |

** How do you use UML?

   #+attr_html: :width 400px
   [[./img/use.gif]]

   | UML as a sketch               | Convey key points, then throw away                                                                                                                |
   | UML as a blueprint            | Detailed system specification. Use UML tool. Reverse and forward engineering to keep model in line with system. Turn portions of model into code. |
   | UML as a programming language | Go from UML model to executable code: every aspect of the system is modeled. Model enables deployment to different environments.                  |

** Case study: airport

   Airports are complicated. Though it does not always go like this:
   watch the [[https://youtu.be/gWYTnc7m9mE][video]] of a 21st century public project scandal. ([[dw][DW 2020]])

   Some services in an airport:

   #+attr_html: :width 400px
   [[./img/airport.png]]

   Three relevant models:
   1) Business system model (passenger services)
   2) IT systems model (enabling passenger services)
   3) System integration model (interacting IT systems)

   #+attr_html: :width 400px
   [[./img/airport1.png]]

   8 diagram types used to model the whole airport ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/mod482/blob/main/11_uml/img/airport.pdf][PDF]]):

*** Sequence diagrams: check in and boarding

    Constructing sequence of actions:

    #+attr_html: :width 400px
    [[./img/airport_sequence1.png]]

    The entire sequence spans the business use cases ~check-in~ and
    ~boarding~:

*** Package diagram: organisational units

    Constructing a package diagram by collecting organizational
    units/roles:

    #+attr_html: :width 400px
    [[./img/airport_package1.png]]

    Package diagram for the organization unit ~Passenger service~:

*** Class diagram: Passenger services

    Illustration of class "generalization". In OOP terms, ~List of
    checked in passengers~ and ~List of passengers not yet on board~
    inherits attributes and methods from ~Passenger List~.

    [[./img/airport_class3.png]]

    Class diagram of ~Passenger services~ including associations
    between them. This way of drawing class diagrams focuses on the
    relationships, not on the methods/functions or abilities of the
    classes.

  | PURPOSE                                      | CASE EXAMPLE                               | VIEW        |
  |----------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+-------------|
  | Specify the context of a system              | Weblog CMS                                 | Logical     |
  | Capture requirements of a system             | Create new blog account                    | Process     |
  | Validate system architecture                 | Specify successful/failed end condition    | Development |
  | Drive implementation and generate test cases | Program and debug use cases with test data | Physical    |

* Use case elements
** Situation
   The problem: "Chinese whispers"

   #+attr_html: :width 600px
   [[./img/projects.png]]

   The solution: Use case modeling

   | Focus    | System *requirements* strictly from the outside looking in |
   | Task     | Specify the *value* that the system delivers to *users*.   |
   | Tools    | User *stories*, project canvas, *agile* workflow (Scrum)   |
   | Excluded | Nonfunctional requirements (e.g. performance targets)      |

** Requirements

   Requirement A.1:

   #+begin_quote
   A content management system (CMS) shall allow an *administrator* to
   *create a new blog account*, provided the personal details of the new
   blogger are *verified* using the *author credentials database*.
   #+end_quote

** System

   | A system is defined by its boundaries. |

   #+attr_html: :width 400px
   [[./img/cms.png]]

** Actors

   | Actors are outside our system (CMS)       |
   | Actors don't have to be actual people     |
   | Actors must interact with the system      |
   | Actors cannot be changed by system design |

   #+attr_html: :width 400px
   [[./img/actor.png]]

*** Tricky actors
    Some actors are tricky: is the ~system clock~ an actor?

    Decision process:

    #+attr_html: :width 400px
    [[./img/actorprocess.png]]

    The ~system clock~ is not a person and it cannot change with the
    system's design (it's part of the given computing
    infrastructure), so it's not an ~actor~.

*** Generalization

    #+attr_html: :width 400px
    [[./img/generalization.png]]

** Use cases

   | Use cases must have clear pass/fail criteria            |
   | All actors must know if the system fulfils the use case |
   | Complete use cases have system interaction and output   |
   | Use cases provide measurable results to users           |

   A use case is drawn as an oval with a name that describes the
   interaction that it represents. E.g. for requirement A.1:

   #+attr_html: :width 400px
   [[./img/blog.png]]

** Communication lines

   | Communication lines are not flow lines     |
   | Communication means purposeful interaction |

   #+attr_html: :width 400px
   [[./img/comm1.png]]

   #+attr_html: :width 400px
   [[./img/comm2.png]]

** System boundaries

   #+attr_html: :width 400px
   [[./img/boundary.png]]

** Descriptions

   | Use cases are too simple to be self-explanatory                 |
   | A use case should be accompanied by description                 |
   | Writing/understanding the description requires domain knowledge |

   | DESCRIPTION DETAIL       | EXAMPLE                                                                     | MEANING                                                                                |

   | Related requirements     | Requirement A.1                                                             | Which requirements this use case fulfils                                               |
   | Goal in context          | New or existing author requests a new blog account from the ~Administrator~ | The use case's place within the system and why this use case is important              |
   | Preconditions            | Author needs to have appropriate proof of identity                          | What needs to happen before the use case can be executed                               |
   | Successful end condition | A new blog account is created for the author                                | What the system's condition should be if the use case executes successfully            |
   | Failed end condition     | The application for a new blog account is rejected                          | What the system's condition should be if the use case fails to execute successfully    |
   | Primary actors           | ~Administrator~                                                             | The main actors that participate in the use case (and triggering or benefiting actors) |
   | Secondary actors         | Author Credentials Database                                                 | Actors that participate but are not the main players in a use case's execution         |
   | Trigger                  | ~Administrator~ asks CMS to ~create a new blog account~                     | The event triggered by an actor that causes the use case to execute                    |
   | Main flow                | 1. Admin asks CMS to create new account                                     | The place to describe each of the important steps in a use case's normal execution     |

** Reusing use cases with ~<<include>>~

   What if we add another similar requirement Requirement A.2:

   #+begin_quote
   The content management system shall allow an *administrator* to
   create a *new personal wiki*, provided the personal details of
   the applying *author* are verified using the *Author Credentials
   Database*.
   #+end_quote

   The requirement is easily added as a new use case:

   #+attr_html: :width 600px
   [[./img/include.png]]

   To indicate that the step ~check identity~ can be reused (without
   changes to the code) it is added as a separate use case with an
   ~<<include>>~ relationship. The ~administrator~ has no part in
   this.

   #+attr_html: :width 600px
   [[./img/include1.png]]

   All use case descriptions need to be updated to include a
   ~Included cases~ category, and the ~main flow~ must contain
   ~include::Check Identity~:

   | Main flow                 | ...                                 |
   | *include::Check Identity* | 4. The author's details are checked |
   |                           | ...                                 |

   The use case itself get its own description:

** Special cases: inheritance

   If there are different blog account types (e.g. with different
   rights), the use cases will differ little. Different types can be
   implemented as special cases, with the original use case as their
   generalization:

   #+attr_html: :width 400px
   [[./img/general.png]]

   The description gets a ~Base Use Case~ field. Here is one of the
   special cases:

   Inheritance is absolute: every step in the general use case must
   occur in the specialized use cases, and its relationships must also
   make sense in the specialized use cases.

   If you don't want this, create a subroutine and ~<<include>>~ it,
   or use the upcoming ~<<extend>>~ relationship.

** Optional reuse with ~<<extend>>~

   The branching action ~5.3~ in the last step shows a use case
   (~Record application failure~) that extends the original use case,
   ~Create new editorial blog account~.

   #+attr_html: :width 600px
   [[./img/extend.png]]


   Very importantly, it is an
   *optional extension*: you don't want to record application failure
   if the application was successful. Like ~Check identity~, this
   extension is shared by both account creation use cases.

** Process optimization with use cases

   Remember "process optimization" in the context of process modeling?
   It also applies to requirements analysis with use case diagrams.

** Create a use case for the term project

   Projects can be seen as systems to be designed. In fact, there is a
   whole (agile) methodology, "design thinking", that rests upon this
   fact. Modeling with diagrams is common when using "design thinking"

   * Create a use case for the term project
   * Begin by answering the following questions:
   
   | What is a suitable system?                        |   |
   | Who are the actors?                               |   |
   | What are the use cases?                           |   |
   | Are any use cases specialized/reusable/extending? |   |

   /Tip: remember that the project is an agile Scrum project./

** Transfer a EPC/BPMN into an UML use case diagram

   Transfer the [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/mod482/blob/main/10_bpmn/README.md#orgadb1ab2][BPMN practice diagram]] that you created (car purchase,
   practice session, or supply chain process) into an UML diagram:

      #+begin_quote
      "Unified Modeling Language (UML) has been highly successful in
      the modeling of software-intensive systems, including
      systems-oriented models and realtime and embedded designs. The
      most common implementation for these models has been C++, with
      the C language in second place. On one hand, this is surprising
      because the most common implementation language for realtime and
      embedded systems overall by far is the language C. On the other
      hand, UML is used almost exclusively for object-oriented systems
      development, and most realtime and embedded designs are
      functionally oriented."  ([[cc][Douglass, 2009]])

* Footnotes

[fn:10]We will use UML in the introduction to programming course for
C/C++ (from spring 2022).

[fn:9](1) ~Live long and prosper~ is subjective - outcome is not
measurable. (2) ~Use case~ - there is no specific action involved. (3)
~Blog account created~ is an outcome of a use case (successful end
event), not a use case.

[fn:8]Sample solution:
| DESCRIPTION DETAIL       | EXAMPLE                                                                                              |
|--------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Use case name            | Record application failure                                                                           |
| Related requirements     | Requirement A.1, Requirement A.2                                                                     |
| Goal in context          | Record author's details if an application for an editorial account has failed                        |
| Preconditions            | Author's application has failed                                                                      |
| Successful end condition | Author's details have been recorded                                                                  |
| Failed end condition     | Author's details were not recorded                                                                   |
| Primary actors           | Administrator                                                                                        |
| Secondary actors         | *None*                                                                                               |
| Trigger                  | ~Administrator~ asks CMS to ~record failed application~ that will allow building an author's history |
| Main flow                | 1. Admin asks CMS to record failed application author's details                                      |
|                          | 2. Admin selects the account type (editorial or regular)                                             |
|                          | 3. Admin enters author's details                                                                     |
| Extensions               | Branching action:                                                                                    |
|                          | 2.1 Admin selects editorial blog account                                                             |
|                          | 2.2 Admin selects regular blog account                                                               |

[fn:7]A ~database~ is not a special case of the ~employee database~,
but the other way around.

[fn:6](1) The ~student~ is an actor but the communication line to the
use case ~create assignment~ is wrong, because that's not what
students do. (2) The R language is not outside of the system that
plots the histogram.

[fn:5] (1) "Global climate" as a system needs to have clear
boundaries. While the globe does, the climate of the globe does not
(the weather on Earth is subject to influences outside the atmosphere,
e.g. sun spots). (2) "God" is not a system at all, but a supernatural
entity that cannot be designed (as a system must be) because He is the
designer.

[fn:4]I had to smile at this comment.

[fn:3]While the general UML overview is quite good, the Use Case
diagram explanation is not great and even contains (in the last
diagram) a few mistakes. The Lucidchart video is way better.

[fn:2]Since 2017: UML 2.5.1 ([[omg][OMG]])
