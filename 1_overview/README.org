* Course overview

You should also look at the syllabus for grading issues. This
presentation "sells" the course itself, including the lecturer. Since
this course was created without much planning time, improvisation
rules. I have worked in modeling for many years, so I'll be able to
provide interesting content according to your interests (within limits).
