  * What are the elements of any process?[fn:3]
  * What's special (if anything) about "business processes"?[fn:4]
  * What's special (if anything) about "IT processes"?[fn:1]
  * Does data play any special role?

* Process modeling

  The three-fold purpose of process modeling:

  * Shared world view (key)
  * Process standardization (means)
  * Process optimization (end)

** Shared world view

*** Answer

    New problem: process model is not *standardized*.

** Process standardization

   ARIS = Meta model for process modeling ("model of models")

* EPCs
** What are "Event-driven Process Chains"?

   #+begin_quote
   The event-driven Process Chain (EPC) is a flow chart for business
   process modeling introduced by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August-Wilhelm_Scheer][August-Wilhelm Scheer]] in the early
   1990s. It illustrates the business process workflows. It uses
   graphical symbols to show the control-flow structure of a business
   process as a chain of events and functions. ([[vp][Visual Paradigm, 2021]])
   #+end_quote

** EPC elements

   #+attr_html: :width 600px
   [[./img/epc.png]]

   /Image source: [[dechow][Dechow et al, 2007]]/

*** Events and functions

    | Function     | Activities carried out by a person |
    | Event        | Status triggered by a function     |
    | Control flow | Sequence of activities             |

    #+attr_html: :width 200px
    [[./img/event1.png]]

    Image source: [[software][Software AG]]

*** Event and function rules

    * Every EPC starts and ends with an event
    * Events and functions alternate


*** Flow

    * Flow represents the flow of time, and is itself represented by a
      solid arrow with a solid tip.
    * All process elements must be connected by flow (arrows)

    #+attr_html: :width 400px
    [[./img/flowrules.png]]

    * Loops are allowed (but careful: maintain model readability)

    #+attr_html: :width 400px
    [[./img/loops.png]]

*** Operators and tokens

    | Operator           | Meaning                                     |
    |--------------------+---------------------------------------------|
    | AND                | All following flows are executed            |
    | OR                 | One or several following flows are executed |
    | XOR (exclusive OR) | Only one of the following flows is executed |

    #+attr_html: :width 300px
    [[./img/operator.png]]

*** Operator rules

    * Must use operator (only) when flow splits or merges
    * Token rule: Splitting operator = joining operator
    * Only the AND operator can split the flow after an event

    #+attr_html: :width 600px
    [[./img/operators.png]]

*** Process interfaces

    * Process interfaces are used to link independent processes
    * Trigger following process or signal preceding process
    * Can only be at the start or at the end of a process diagram

      #+attr_html: :width 300px
    [[./img/interface.png]]

*** Organizational units

    * Organizational units are only connected to functions
    * They are RACI - Responsible, Accountable, Consulted and Informed

      [[./img/raci.png]]

** Extended Event-driven Process Chain (eEPC)

   eEPCs integrate the other views of the ARIS house:

   * Roles/organization
   * Products/services
   * Data input/output

     [[./img/eepc.png]]

** EPC rules summary

   This is the complete lists of rules and recommendations. Despite
   the apparent simplicity of this modeling language, it is incredibly
   expressive - so much so that for example all of the 80,000 basic
   transaction of an SAP Enterprise Resource Planning system are
   modeled using EPCs.[fn:2]

   |    | Rule                                                    |
   |----+---------------------------------------------------------|
   |  1 | Every EPC starts and ends with an event                 |
   |  2 | Events and functions alternate                          |
   |  3 | Must use operator (only) when flow splits or merges     |
   |  4 | Splitting operator = joining operator                   |
   |  5 | Only the AND operator can split the flow after an event |
   |  6 | Interfaces only before or after a process               |
   |  7 | Organizational units are only connected to functions    |
   |  8 | All process elements must be connected by flow          |
   |  9 | Loops are allowed as long as they're finite             |
   | 10 | Trivial events can be omitted                           |

   Here is a complete EPC "cheat sheet" (Source: Software AG)

   #+attr_html: :width 600px
   [[./img/cheatsheet.png]]

* Practice - EPC Lab

  [[./img/practice.gif]]

  Tip: [[https://online.visual-paradigm.com/knowledge/business-design-tools/what-is-epc-diagram/#][This platform allows you to play around in their online editor.]]

** Signavio demo

   #+attr_html: :width 300px
   [[./img/signavio.png]]

   * Fire up the [[https://academic.signavio.com][Signavio process editor]]
   * Let's draw some EPC diagrams
   * Create your models in your own folder

** Find the mistakes

*** Problem

    * Find all mistakes in the EPC diagram!
    * Do not fix mistakes as you go along
    * There are 11 mistakes in total

      #+attr_html: :width 400px
      [[./img/diagram.png]]

*** Solution

    One could count the operator between Event 6 and 7 as a 12th
    mistake - it's a double mistake: the operator shouldn't be here
    and there ought to be a function instead.

    #+attr_html: :width 600px
    [[./img/diagram_solution.png]]

** Fill in a process model

*** Problem

    The following process ("Invoice Check") has already been modeled
    for you.

    #+begin_quote
    "The invoice is checked by accounts payable when 1) the receipt
    for incoming goods, 2) the invoice, and 3) the sales order, have
    all been received. If the invoice is correct, it will be paid. If
    it is not correct, an inquiry process is triggered. The process is
    linked to four process interfaces: incoming -(1) incoming goods,
    (2) sales, and - outgoing - (3) payment, (4) inquiry."
    #+end_quote

    1) Draw the diagram in Signavio (in your folder)
    2) Read the process description carefully
    3) Name all elements including the operators
    4) Name and save your diagram

       #+attr_html: :width 400px
       [[./img/invoice_problem.png]]

    /The diagram contains rule violations. Why?/

*** Solution

    Things to consider:
    * Stick as close to the problem description as you can - don't
      make stuff up, change words or "improve" the process unless
      requested.
    * Don't change the standard size of process elements. If an event
      or a function don't seem to fit in the element, it is likely
      that you need to rethink your model (e.g. the activity may be
      too large and needs to be split up).

       #+attr_html: :width 400px
       [[./img/invoice_solution.png]]

** A puzzling question
   
   [[./img/puzzle.gif]]

*** Problem

    | Can all processes be modeled with languages like EPCs? |

*** Solution

    Yes and no...it depends on the ability to measure what's going
    on. Process models - at least in the area of business and
    technology - can only express things or actions that are
    quantifiable.

** Model a whole process

*** Problem

    Consider the following process description[fn:5]:

    #+begin_quote
    "When programming in a compiled language (like C), you have to
    create a source code file using an editor. (This can be quite
    tricky if you use Emacs and haven't used it much before.) The
    compiler compiles the file and links it to a library. Finally you
    run the program.
    #+end_quote

    * Consider first what type of process this is
    * Model this process as an EPC in Signavio
    * Name the process "Compilation"
    * Save it in your personal folder
    * EPC models are usually drawn vertically

*** Solution

    This is a sample solution. Process modeling is not an exact
    science, and there is always more than one answer.

**** Simple solution - happy path

     #+attr_html: :width 300px

**** Complete solution - extended EPC

[fn:5]The idea for this problem came from a figure in a book I'm
reading, "Tiny C Projects" ([[gookin][Gookin, 2021]]):
[[./img/cycle.png]]

[fn:4]Business processes generate added value.

[fn:3]Different languages use different terms:(1)
*Functions*/tasks/actions/activities; (2) *events*/status/trigger; (3)
*flow*/path/sequence/connectors; (4) *operators*/gateways/decisions.

[fn:2]Any productive ERP system contains many more transactions than
that. In practice, these are often modeled as BPMN diagrams, or as ER
Diagrams, if customer-facing or database operations are being
modeled. For more about ERP systems, see this tutorial ([[sap][SAP]]).
